# CP1404 Practicals

## Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404

## Brief information about repo and myself

My name is Tin Nilar Soe. I am a Burmese (from Myanmar) and I'm currently studying in the second trimester of Bachelor
of Information Technology at James Cook University, Singapore.
This is the repository for CP1404: Programming II practicals and each practical is required to be submitted weekly.
These practicals together with weekly quizzes contribute 30% of the total marks for the final grade. Practicals include
python coding and use of version control. There are also peers code reviews starting from practical 5.

## 3 main lessons about "clean code"

- Follow PEP 8 guidelines: Reformat the file after writing the code to ensure that the code has clear readability. Use
  docstrings for functions, classes, methods and hashtag for comments.
- Break down the large function into smaller, more manageable functions which follow SRP (Single-Responsibility
  Principle), meaning one function should handle only one task.
- Follow Naming Convention for naming things in python. For example, variables with lower-case letters and constants
  with upper-case letters. Functions should start with verb, etc.
