# Reflection

Throughout the practicals during the course, my accuracy in estimating the practical tasks varied. Initially, I could not accurately gauge the time needed for certain practicals, often underestimating the complexity involved. However, as I become more familiar with the subject, my accuracy improved. I learned how to gauge the time taken for smaller functions and made the estimates nearly the same as the actual time taken for the overall project.

In terms of code reviews, both receiving and doing reviews provided valuable learning experiences. From being reviewed, I gained insights into coding best practices and recognized the mistakes that I didn't notice before. By conducting reviews, I learned to critically evaluate codes and found that providing feedback to peers create a collaborative learning environment.

Reflecting on the practical tasks overall, if I were in charge of the subject, I would introduce more interactive coding exercises and mini-projects to reinforce key concepts. Moreover, I would encourage collaborative project work to simulate real-world development scenarios.

# Code Reviews

[prac_05](https://github.com/ivy-naw-mth/cp1404practicals/pull/2#event-12142998178): In this review, I mainly mentioned naming standards and explained the use of EAFP method.

[prac_07](https://github.com/DianaBukeikhanova/cp1404practicals/pull/4#event-12226011160): In this review, I managed to catch an error that did not aligned with the output among a lot of files.
